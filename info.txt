*LaTeX Template for Scientific Preprints*

This project provides a lightweight and customizable LaTeX template for writing scientific preprints, independent of any specific journal design. It is meant to offer a clean, professional structure for sharing research work before formal submission or publication.

A fictional example article is included with typical sections, following a two-column format, filled with placeholder text (\lipsum) to showcase the visual rendering.
